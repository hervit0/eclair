# Eclair :zap:

:fr: _lightining bolt_

Eclair repos are personal repos to:
- experiment
- tutorial
- sandboxes
- code kata

As the number of eclairs was increasing a lot, I thought it would be a good idea to centralize them as I go.

## Eclairs

- dart
- rust
- typescript
- go
- elm
- haskell

## Legacy eclairs
